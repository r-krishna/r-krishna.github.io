			<h1>About</h1>
			<p> My various interests have led me from studying the biochemistry of natural product biosynthesis pathways to starting a student run management consulting firm and back to identifying structural features from protein sequences. In the future, I hope to be able to leverage computational tools to characterize and engineer biological systems. </p>
