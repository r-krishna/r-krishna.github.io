			<h1>About</h1>
			<p> My various interests have led me from studying the biochemistry of natural product biosynthesis pathways to co-founding a student run management <a href="https://vcg.berkeley.edu/">consulting firm</a> and back to identifying structural features from protein sequences. In the future, I hope to be able to leverage computational tools to characterize and engineer biological systems. 
			<br>
				<br>
				Outside of science, I enjoy long distance running, hip hop music and watching professional sports.
