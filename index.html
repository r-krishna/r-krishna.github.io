			<!-- <h1>Hi there, I'm Rohith Krishna!</h1> -->
			<p>

				I TRAIN DEEP LEARNING MODELS TO PREDICT CHEMICAL STRUCTURES. THESE MODELS WILL DESIGN IDEAL MOLECULES THAT ARE BETTER THERAPEUTICS, MATERIALS AND MORE. 
				I RANDOMLY COLLAB WITH FRIENDS. I RELEASE MODELS WHEN I FEEL LIKE IT. MOLECULES HAVE STRUCTURE BUT I DO NOT. THIS IS MY PERSONAL SITE FOR ALL THINGS CREATIVE.
				<!-- I graduated from UC Berkeley, where I studied Chemical Biology and Computer Science. 
				I spent most of my time working on biochemistry and protein engineering projects in  <a href="https://keaslinglab.lbl.gov/">Prof. Jay Keasling's lab</a>.
				I moved on to work on building software tools to accelerate protein engineering and antibody discovery at <a href="https://www.denalitherapeutics.com/">Denali therapeutics</a>.
				Now I'm captivated by the power of deep learning to design proteins that have superior biophysical properties for therapeutics, materials and many other applications.  -->
