			<h1>Hi there, I'm Rohith Krishna!</h1>
			<p>I recently graduated from UC Berkeley, studying Chemical Biology and Computer Science. I spent most of my time working on projects in biochemistry and protein engineering in Prof. Jay Keasling's lab. I am interested in computational structural biology, machine learning and protein engineering.
			Outside of science, I enjoy long distance running, hip hop music and watching professional sports. <a href="/about">Read more about my life...</a></p>
