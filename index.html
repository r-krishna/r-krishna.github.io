			<h1>Hi there, I'm Rohith Krishna!</h1>
			<p>
				I graduated from UC Berkeley, where I studied Chemical Biology and Computer Science. 
				I spent most of my time working on biochemistry and protein engineering projects in  <a href="https://keaslinglab.lbl.gov/">Prof. Jay Keasling's lab</a>.
				I moved on to work on building software tools to accelerate protein engineering and antibody discovery at <a href="https://www.denalitherapeutics.com/">Denali therapeutics</a>.
				Now I'm captivated by the power of deep learning to design proteins that have superior biophysical properties for therapeutics, materials and many other applications.

				Check out my <a href="/blog">blog</a> to check out some side projects I've built or am interested in.
