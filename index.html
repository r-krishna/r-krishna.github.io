			<h1>Hi there, I'm Rohith Krishna!</h1>
			<p>I recently graduated from UC Berkeley, where I studied Chemical Biology and Computer Science. I spent most of my time working on projects in biochemistry and protein engineering in  <a href="https://keaslinglab.lbl.gov/">Prof. Jay Keasling's lab</a>. I am interested in protein structure prediction, machine learning and protein engineering.
			<br>
				Outside of science, I enjoy long distance running, hip hop music and watching professional sports.</p>
