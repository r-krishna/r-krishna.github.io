Hi, I'm Rohith Krishna!

I recently graduated from UC Berkeley, studying Chemical Biology and Computer Science. I spent most of my time working on projects in biochemistry and protein engineering in Prof. Jay Keasling's lab. I am interested in computational structural biology, machine learning and protein engineering. 

Outside of science, I enjoy long distance running, hip hop music and watching professional sports.
