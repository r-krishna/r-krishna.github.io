First post from my new website!

Update 5/27/2021:
I am reactivating this site to get some of my thoughts out. Two of my goals in 2021 have been:
1. To write more. I think writing is super important to synthesizing thoughts and getting feedback on ideas. Communicating verbally is valuable but I think it is much easier to "bs" your way out of a verbal discussion than a written one.
2. Follow through on more of my ideas. While I don't have access to a wet lab anymore, I am more comfortable with playing with ideas in silico. I'm hoping that the pressure of writing up ideas will force me to be more motivated to follow through with them.

Disclaimer: Anything I write about on this page was done completely with my own personal resources and do not reflect the opinions/views of my current or former employers. 

Most of the ideas/projects I put up here are going to be very rough and I plan to iterate on these projects as I get time and feedback. If you have any ideas or thoughts, email me or DM me on Twitter!
